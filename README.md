# Damascus Library
Damascus Library is a tiny service where people may upload their favorite
e-Books or even own docs. Furthermore, they could bookmark their podcasts. 


The Library API webservice is mainly using the HTTP RESTful principles along with a serverless
architecture -AWS Lambda-ready-.

We also make use of some Domain-Driven Design concepts and some microservices
structures -like folder structure-.

### Disclaimer
This is meant to be migrated to a complete microservice approach. 
Nevertheless, the serverless approach is completely safe and you should only take
considerations once the application gets eventually bigger or if the cloud-stored functions' performance
is not a choice  for your company's needs.
